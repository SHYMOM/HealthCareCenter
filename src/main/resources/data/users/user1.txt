appointment and healthrecords are not a fixed size so there can be more appointment and more health records and don't add the appointment list or health record at first it will be added after the registration is completed i will call the user class from registration class
            else {
                User user = new User(name.getText(), username.getText(), Integer.parseInt(age.getText()), email.getText(), address.getText(), contactNumber.getText(), password.getText(), selectedBloodGroup, selectedGender);
                final String filePath = "data/users/"+username.getText()+".txt";
                
                try {
                    user.saveToFile(filePath);
                } catch (IOException ex) {

                }
                this.dispose();
                new loginFrame();
            }

after calling the saveToFile(filePath) method it will initially create a new file named as the user name and save the initial details like
<<<---File-Start--->
[User]
name=Name
username=UserName
age=20
email=useremail@email.com
address=Address
contactNumber=123456785
password=123qweasd
bloodGroup=B+
gender=Male
role=User
isDonor=false

[Bills]
appointmentCost=100
medicineCost=50
testCost=30
otherCost=10

[Appointments]


[HealthRecords]


<<<---File-End--->>>



and make another class called getUserData class which will have setter and getter methods to get a user specific details using users username
setName(String filePath, String newName){}
String getName(String filePath){the file path will get using FileUtils.getFile(filePath) a method from FileUtils class}
and this class will be used to update the user details. And also make a method to get the user details except the password and username in a HashMap format.
so the hashmap will contain all the user details except the password and username. and maybe the appointments and health records will be in Array Of HashMap.

the appointment and health records will be in a format like

[Appointments]

<<<Appoint-Start>>>
doctorName = Dr. Name
doctorId = 1234
time = 10:00 AM
date = 2023-04-01
appointmentCost = 100
status = Pending
<<<Appoint-End>>>

<<<Appoint-Start>>>
doctorName = Dr. Alice
doctorId = 1234
time = 11:30 AM
date = 2024-01-02
appointmentCost = 100
status = Confirmed
<<<Appoint-End>>>

[HealthRecords]

<<<HealthRecord-Start>>>
date = 2023-04-01
symptoms = Symptoms
diagnosis = Diagnosis
medicines = Medicines
tests = Tests
<<<HealthRecord-End>>>

<<<HealthRecord-Start>>>
date = 2023-04-01
symptoms = Symptoms
diagnosis = Diagnosis
medicines = Medicines
tests = Tests
<<<HealthRecord-End>>>
